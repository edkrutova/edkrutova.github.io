When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in “What You See Is What You Get” word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references. A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MiKTeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution.\nLaTeX is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields, including mathematics, computer science, engineering, physics, chemistry, economics, linguistics, quantitative psychology, philosophy, and political science. It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials, such as Sanskrit and Greek. LaTeX uses the TeX typesetting program for formatting its output, and is itself written in the TeX macro language.\n","date":1652054400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652054400,"objectID":"75b881dcb33092e405db4b74fe9a32a0","permalink":"https://edkrutova.github.io/post/latex/","publishdate":"2022-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/latex/","section":"post","summary":"LaTeX","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Last week","type":"post"},{"authors":["Krutova Ekaterina"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Overview Actually, nothing interesting happened.

Usually the main project tree is stored in the local or a remote repository to which access is configured for project members. If somebody makes changes to the content of the project, the version control system allows them to fix, combine changes made by different project participants, rollback to any earlier version of the project, if required.\nClassical version control systems use a centralized model, assuming a single repository for storing files. Most of the version control functions are performed by a dedicated server.The project participant (user) before starting work through certain command gets the version of files it needs. After making changes, the user commits the new version to the repository. This does not remove previous versions from the central repository and you can return to them at any time. The server can save not the full version of the modified files, but produce the so-called delta compression - save only changes between successive versions, which allows you to reduce the amount of stored data.\nVersion control systems support traceability and resolution conflicts that may arise when several people work on one file. You can merge (merge) changes made by different participants (automathically or manually), manually select the desired version, cancel the changes altogether or lock files for modification. Depending on the settings, blocking is not allows other users to get a working copy or prevents modification working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file.\nVersion control systems can also provide additional, more flexible functionality. For example, they can support work with several versions of the same file, keeping a common history of changes up to the branch point versions and each branch’s own change histories. In addition, it is usually available information about which of the participants, when and what changes were made. Usually this kind of information is stored in the change log, access to which can be restricted.\nUnlike classical ones, in distributed version control systems, the central the repository is optional.\nAmong the classic VCS, CVS, Subversion are the most famous, and among the distributed nyh - Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. The principles of their work are similar, they differ mainly the syntax of the commands used in the work.\n","date":1651622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651622400,"objectID":"ff6c677cb77562ac25e00b495aaa9f84","permalink":"https://edkrutova.github.io/post/control_versions/","publishdate":"2022-05-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/control_versions/","section":"post","summary":"Translated article from our course.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Post about Version control.
